# QCraft

##### qCraft is a mod that brings the principles of quantum physics to the world of Minecraft.

qCraft is not intended as a simulation of quantum mechanics or quantum computing. Instead, its purpose is to introduce players into the fascinating and (in the context of the macro-world we inhabit) counterintuitive way that quantum entities interact. By interpreting quantum science in Minecraft, it is intended to provide 'analogies' that give players insight into how quantum behaviors are different from everyday experience. Specific block information and introduction to key quantum concepts for the original qCraft project can be found here - http://qcraft.org
